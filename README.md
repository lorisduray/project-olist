# Project Olist: E-commerce Profit Analysis

## Objective

This project aims to analyze a dataset provided by **Olist**, a leading e-commerce service in Brazil, to answer a critical business question posed by the CEO:

**How can Olist increase its profit?**

## Company Overview

Olist connects merchants to Brazil's largest marketplaces, offering a comprehensive range of services including:
- **Inventory management**
- **Customer reviews and communication**
- **Logistic services**

Sellers pay Olist a monthly fee, which scales with the volume of orders processed through the platform.

### Seller Workflow:
1. Seller joins Olist
2. Seller uploads their product catalog
3. Seller is notified when a product is sold
4. Seller hands the product to a logistics carrier  
ðŸ‘‰ Multiple sellers can be involved in a single customer order.

### Customer Workflow:
1. Customer browses products on the Olist marketplace
2. Customer makes a purchase from Olist.store
3. Customer receives an estimated delivery date
4. Customer receives the product
5. Customer leaves a review (even before the product is delivered!)  
ðŸ‘‰ Reviews can be left as soon as the order is shipped, which means customers may review products before receiving them.

## Dataset

The dataset contains **~100,000 orders** made between **2016 and 2018** on the Olist store, and it includes:

- Order details (dates, prices, etc.)

- Review scores
- Product information
- Delivery status

You can access the dataset as CSV files from **Le Wagon's S3 bucket**.
